Google Maps includes a feature called My Places, which allows users to save maps with multiple locations. They are useful for planning trips, noting good restaurants, etc. These maps can be viewed on the iPad's Google Maps app, but only if the URL is in a special format. Furthermore, there's no easy way to get a list of a user's My Places on the iPad. This web application fixes all that. When a user logs in, they are presented with a list of their maps. Clicking the name of a map opens it in the iPad's Maps app. It's that easy.
